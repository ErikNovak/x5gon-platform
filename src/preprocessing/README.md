# Material Pre-processing Pipeline

This folder contains the code base for OER material pre-processing pipeline. The pipeline is created
using qtopology which is a distributed stream processing layer.


**Disclaimer**: The pipeline is NOT yet finished. Feature/information extraction methods are still
missing as well as the components that handle Wikification and DMoz classification. The latter will
be added shortly while the information extraction components are still pending.
